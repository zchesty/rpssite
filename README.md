*/*Work in Progress*/*

This is a simple Rock Paper Scissors app. It was inspired by this New York Times Post (http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/science/rock-paper-scissors.html). I helped create a command line app in an Intro to Computer Science class in C++ with a group. After taking a web development class I decided to use the same ideas and make it into an interactive website.
